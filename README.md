For the project to work properly both the API and SPA must be in the same folder.

Please take all the files from Subproject 2 API and all the files from Subproject 3 SPA and put them in the same folder.

The SPA was build to depend on the API for everything related to data loading and everything related to that.

There are no special credentials for the API or SPA.
